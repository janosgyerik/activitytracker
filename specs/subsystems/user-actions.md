What is an activity?
--------------------

Something you want to track in your life.
For example:

- Beer night with friends
- Went to the gym to work out / zumba
- Went running
- Took the stairs
- Washed the dishes
- Cleaned the bathroom
- Cooked vs eat at restaurant
- Ate at McDonald's
- Studied vocabulary with Anki

Recording an activity
---------------------

Input fields:

- Short keyword: +autosuggest from recently used words to reduce typing
- Dropdown menu with recently used activity names
- Date and time: *now* by default, but editable using a nice calendar interface
- Later: add tags
- Later: add custom memo

Activities can have an optional long description which you can add or edit anytime.
When entering activities and when listing,
the short name should be used,
which might not be very descriptive, but something personal that you understand.

For example the above ideas with short names to use in the app:

- Beers -- Beer night with friends
- Gym -- Went to the gym to work out / zumba
- Running -- Went running
- Stairs -- Took the stairs
- Washed the dishes
- Cleaned the bathroom
- Cooked vs eat at restaurant
- Ate at McDonald's
- Studied vocabulary with Anki

Activities, habits
------------------

An activity or habit has a short name.

- [+] button to record activity easily, with visual feedback and buzz
- possible to undo, but carefully, or add also undo-undo
- option to pop-up confirmation on recording
- date and time is recorded with activity
- count of activity is shown, where count can be:
    - count for today / this week / this month / this year
    - maybe different color for time unit
    - default count unit
    - customizable count per activity
    - activities can be grouped
    - pills UI to toggle weekly / monthly / daily activities

Periodicity
-----------

Activities can have a periodicity:

- daily, examples:
    - climbed stairs
    - 20 pushups
    - power yoga

- weekly, examples:
    - went to gym
    - wiped the dust
    - vacuumed
    - took out trash
    - awake at midnight
    - cooked

- monthly, examples:
    - went to gym

- yearly, examples:
    - went to gym
    - went to snowboard
    - went to beach

The periodicity controls the counter's behavior:
counter resets when a new cycle begins.

Also controls the plotting. (How, exactly?...)
