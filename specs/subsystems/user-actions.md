User actions
============

Things that users can do with the app.

Activities, habits
------------------

An activity or habit has a short name.

- [+] button to record activity easily, with visual feedback and buzz
- possible to undo, but carefully, or add also undo-undo
- option to pop-up confirmation on recording
- date and time is recorded with activity
- count of activity is shown, where count can be:
    - count for today / this week / this month / this year
    - maybe different color for time unit
    - default count unit
    - customizable count per activity
    - activities can be grouped
    - pills UI to toggle weekly / monthly / daily activities

Periodicity
-----------

Activities can have a periodicity:

- daily, examples:
    - climbed stairs
    - 20 pushups
    - power yoga

- weekly, examples:
    - went to gym
    - wiped the dust
    - vacuumed
    - took out trash
    - awake at midnight
    - cooked

- monthly, examples:
    - went to gym

- yearly, examples:
    - went to gym
    - went to snowboard
    - went to beach

The periodicity controls the counter's behavior:
counter resets when a new cycle begins.

Also controls the plotting. (How, exactly?...)
